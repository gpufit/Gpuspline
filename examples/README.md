# Gpuspline examples

The examples require a binary distribution or a built version of Gpuspline and either Matlab or Python as environment. They demonstrate the basic usage of 
the Gpuspline API. Please also see the [documentation](https://gpuspline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) of Gpuspline.

Examples showing how to fit with splines use [Gpufit](https://github.com/gpufit/Gpufit) and can be found at the examples section of Gpufit.
